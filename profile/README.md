The [Virtual Assembly](https://virtual-assembly.org) is an ecosystem of people and organizations developing commons (tools, methodologies and projects) in a collaborative way to empower the Transition movement.

It was created in 2011 and has about forty active contributors involved in about twenty projects.

It makes intensive use of the semantic web and the peer-to-peer approaches.
